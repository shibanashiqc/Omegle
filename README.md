# License

In order help ensure fairness and sharing, this library is dual-licensed. Be aware that all usage, unless otherwise specified, is under the RPL-1.5 license!

    Reciprocal Public License 1.5 (RPL-1.5): https://opensource.org/licenses/RPL-1.5

You should read the entire license; especially the PREAMBLE at the beginning. In short, the word reciprocal means "giving something back in return for what you are getting". It is not a freeware license. This license requires that you open-source all of your own source code for any project which uses this library! Creating and maintaining this library is endless hard work for us. That's why there is one simple requirement for you: Give something back to the world. Whether that's code or financial support for this project is entirely up to you, but nothing else grants you any right to use this library.

Furthermore, the library is also available to certain entities under a modified version of the RPL-1.5, which has been modified to allow you to use the library without open-sourcing your own project. The modified license (see LICENSE_PREMIUM) is granted to certain entities, at our discretion, and for a limited period of time (unless otherwise agreed), pursuant to our terms. Currently, we are granting this license to all "premium subscribers" for the duration of their subscriptions. You can become a premium subscriber by either contributing substantial amounts of high-quality code, or by subscribing for a fee. This licensing ensures fairness and stimulates the continued growth of this library through both code contributions and the financial support it needs.

You are not required to accept this License since you have not signed it, however nothing else grants you permission to use, copy, distribute, modify, or create derivatives of either the Software (this library) or any Extensions created by a Contributor. These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by performing any of these actions You indicate Your acceptance of this License and Your agreement to be bound by all its terms and conditions. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH ALL THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS LICENSE DO NOT USE, MODIFY, CREATE DERIVATIVES, OR DISTRIBUTE THE SOFTWARE. IF IT IS IMPOSSIBLE FOR YOU TO COMPLY WITH ALL THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS LICENSE THEN YOU CAN NOT USE, MODIFY, CREATE DERIVATIVES, OR DISTRIBUTE THE SOFTWARE.
